/**
 * When specified as part of code generation, processes all types after they
 * are computed, but before they are written to disk.  This allows you to make
 * arbitrary modifications to types such as implementing your own interfaces,
 * renaming fields, or anything you might wish to do.
 *
 * <p>For example, a processor that implements java.lang.Serializable on all
 * generated types:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class SerializableTypeProcessor implements TypeProcessor {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public TypeSpec process(TypeSpec type) {
 *         TypeSpec builder = type.toBuilder();
 *
 *         builder.addSuperinterface(Serializable.class);
 *         builder.addField(FieldSpec.builder(long.class, "serialVersionUID")
 *                 .addModifiers(Modifier.PRIVATE, Modifier.STATIC, Modifier.FINAL)
 *                 .initializer("$L", -1)
 *                 .build());
 *
 *         return builder.build();
 *     }
 * }
